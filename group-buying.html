  <h2>Group Buying</h2>
  <p>Join our group buying events to enjoy premium products at unbeatable prices.</p>

  <p>
    The concept originated over a decade ago, initially supporting cooking and baking communities by providing high-quality products at affordable prices.
    Since then, it has evolved into a trusted, community-driven platform and a top seller on Korea’s leading N portal.
  </p>

  <p>
    The group buying process begins with GoMine negotiating supply terms with trusted suppliers. 
    Once terms are confirmed, members place pre-orders for featured products. 
    GoMine then places a collective order, receives the goods upon fulfillment, and arranges delivery or pickup for its members.
