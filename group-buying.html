    <h2>Group Buying</h2>
    <p>Join our group buying events to enjoy premium products at unbeatable prices.</p>

    <p>
      The concept originated over a decade ago, initially supporting cooking and baking communities by providing high-quality products at affordable prices.
      Since then, it has evolved into a trusted, community-driven platform and a top seller on Korea’s leading N portal.
    </p>

    <p>We collaborate with trusted suppliers to bring you exclusive deals on limited-time, high-demand items.</p>
    <p>Our community-driven model ensures that when more people buy, everyone saves more.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>✓ Curated product selections</li>
      <li>✓ Limited-time offers</li>
      <li>✓ Pickup or delivery options</li>
      <li>✓ Transparent pricing with no surprises</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Stay tuned for upcoming group buys, or follow us on social media for live updates.</p>
